# Super-Store-Sales-Dashboard-Using-PowerBi
## Project-Objective
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using Super Store sales data to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making for managers. The dashboard visualizes over ₹522K in sales and ₹67K in profit, tracking performance across regions, product categories, customer segments, shipping modes, and payment methods. It includes advanced features like quarterly and monthly trend analysis, sub-category breakdowns, forecasting, and profitability by quantity. This project highlights my ability to clean, model, and visualize data effectively to generate actionable insights.

## Project Insights:
1.The Power BI dashboard revealed that the Central region led in both sales and profit, with Phones, Chairs, and the Technology category emerging as top-selling items.  
2.The Consumer segment was the most valuable, contributing 48% of total sales, while Cash on Delivery (43%) was the preferred payment method.  
3.Seasonal trends showed that Q4 had the highest sales, likely due to year-end demand, whereas Q1 recorded the lowest.  
4.Among shipping methods, Standard Class was used most frequently. The forecasting features indicated a positive growth trend, and while the average delivery time of 4 days was acceptable, it presents an opportunity for improvement.  
5.Lastly, the analysis highlighted that some regions with high sales had low profit margins, emphasizing the importance of monitoring discount strategies and operational costs  

## Final Conclusion: 
This Power BI dashboard successfully delivers a comprehensive view of sales performance. It demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence. With clear visuals, dynamic filters, and forecasting, it empowers decision-makers to identify growth opportunities, reduce operational delays, and plan for the future with confidence.
