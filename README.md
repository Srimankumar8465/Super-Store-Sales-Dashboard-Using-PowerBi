## Power BI Project Highlights:
This project involved building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Super Store sales data and generate key insights to support business decision-making. The process began with importing multiple datasets—Orders, Products, Customers, and Regions—into Power BI Desktop. Using Power Query Editor, the data was cleaned, data types were fixed, null values were removed, and the tables were organized for proper modeling.

Further data transformation was done in Power Query by merging tables, renaming columns, and applying filters. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was then used to create essential measures such as total sales, profit, discount rates, and year-over-year growth. Some key metrics calculated included: Total Sales of ₹522.44K, Profit of ₹67.86K, 7298 units sold, and an average delivery time of 4 days. New columns and tables were created to support time-based insights and custom segments.

## Final Conclusion: 
This Power BI dashboard successfully delivers a comprehensive view of sales performance. It demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence. With clear visuals, dynamic filters, and forecasting, it empowers decision-makers to identify growth opportunities, reduce operational delays, and plan for the future with confidence.
